# jquery 2 demo

These demos are related to pages 332-366 in Jon Duckett's *[JavaScript and jQuery](http://javascriptbook.com)*. They cover jQuery's capabilities for basic effects, DOM traversal, adding and filtering elements, finding elements by their order, cutting and copying elements, and getting and setting box dimensions, window and page dimensions, and the position of elements.

Though this repository contains a single file, this file should be seen as dozens of files (one file per commit). The important content is the [commit history](https://github.com/saulbaizman-massart/jquery-2/commits/master) which contains detailed annotations of the changes I made to the file. You can view the file at every step of the way and download a copy of the file at any point in time.
